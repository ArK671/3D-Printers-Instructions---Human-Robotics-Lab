## Print Settings for Each Filament

In this folder, you will find the file Printer & Filaments Settings containing the recommended print settings for the filaments currently available in the lab.  
Please download the file and import it into your slicer through **File-> Import -> Import Configs**. Then, on Project Filaments click on the filament name to open the tab you will see **Custom** under **User Presets** and if you move your cursor on it you can choose the settings for the filaments that we have in the lab. Finally, you can add your STL file to the project and follow the provided instructions.

This document will be updated regularly based on the filaments available in our lab.

1. For **PLA**, we are currently using **ESUN PLA+**.

2. For **TPU**, we currently have **ESUN TPU 95A** and **ESUN TPE 83A**.  
   The recommended settings for each type are included in this folder and can be imported into **Bambu Studio**.
